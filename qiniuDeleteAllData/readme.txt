相信大家都在使用七牛的免费云存储服务的同时，有清空七牛云存储镜像文件或者批量删除七牛云空间文件的需求，该怎么做？
官方的工具好像并没有提供批量删除的功能，七牛云官方给出的建议是删除空间，
再新建一个这样太麻烦，毕竟审核域名需要时间的！
更有人在七牛上全选删除，一页一页的删除！文件少还好，要是N万条数据,只能呵呵了

I believe we are using seven cattle free cloud storage services, there are empty seven cattle cloud storage image file, or batch delete seven cattle cloud file space needs, how to do?
The official tools do not seem to provide bulk delete capabilities, and the advice given by the seven cattle cloud is to remove the space,
It's too much trouble to build another one. After all, it takes time to review the domain name!
More people select Delete in seven cattle, delete a page! File less, okay, if N 10000 data, can only ha ha
